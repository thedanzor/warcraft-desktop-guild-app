About The project
-------------

This is a project using ElectronJs, NodeJs, NPM, ES6 and AvaJS to build a desktop application for World of Warcraft. It's currently in a pre-alpha stage with only the foundation of the application being setup.

* Event driven communication between components / Utils
* Basic State management
* Initial login component
* The application Setup Component
* Initial design and animations

The goal is to build a fully working application that will enable guild masters to mange their guilds. While also open sourcing the code so developers can take advantage of the code in the various stages for their own projects.

Guild Masters and Officers will have the ability to manage events, dkp, raid rosters and potentially more in the initial release. 

Updates will be sparatic as work on this is done in my limited spare time.
